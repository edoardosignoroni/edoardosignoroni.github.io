I am currently a PhD Student at the [NLP Centre](https://nlp.fi.muni.cz/) at the [Faculty of Informatics](https://www.fi.muni.cz/), Masaryk University in Brno, CZ. I work on machine translation for low-resource languages and domains, advised by [Pavel Rychly](https://www.fi.muni.cz/~pary/).

I obtained my Master's degree cum laude from the [University of Pavia](https://portale.unipv.it/it) in [Theorethical and Applied Linguistics](https://portale.unipv.it/it/didattica/corsi-di-laurea/corsi-di-laurea-magistrale/linguistica-teorica-applicata-e-delle-lingue) with a thesis titled *Word Usage Change and the Pandemic: A Computational Analysis of Short-Term Usage Change in the Italian Reddit Community* supervised by [Elisabetta Jezek](https://studiumanistici.unipv.it/?pagina=docenti&id=135) and [Rachele Sprugnoli](https://personale.unipr.it/it/ugovdocenti/person/236480).

My Bachelor's degree in [Foreign Languages and Literatures](https://lt-llsm.unibg.it/it) was done at the [University of Bergamo](https://www.unibg.it/), focussing on Japanese and English. My thesis, supervised by [Marco Taddei](https://didattica-rubrica.unibg.it/ugov/person/6749), dealt with *Himiko, Yamatai, and the Birth of the Japanese Nation*.

I am from a small city in the province of Brescia, Italy. In my free time, I enjoy training [Kendo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kendo), travelling, hiking, playing videogames, partaking in everything fantasy-related from books to TV series, and forgetting stuff.
